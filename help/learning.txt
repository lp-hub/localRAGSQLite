The Model Learns Nothing. Ever.

    The model does not “learn” from FAISS, and it does not retain anything when the FAISS index is replaced. All knowledge injection is temporary and query-based, not permanent.


In a RAG system (using FAISS + LLM like GPT or LLaMA):

    Your FAISS DB stores vector embeddings of document chunks.

    At query time:

        You ask a question.

        FAISS retrieves the most semantically relevant chunks.

        These chunks are injected into the prompt as context.

    The LLM uses that temporary context to generate a response.

    The model is still frozen. It only "knows" the chunked information during that one generation.


So What Happens When You Replace the FAISS DB?

    You lose access to all the previous chunks.

    The model instantly forgets anything that was only available through that old index.

    There is no residual memory or accumulation.

This is not a bug — it's just how stateless inference with static LLMs works.


Your model doesn't "gain knowledge" from FAISS — it only borrows context from it when you query. Once that index is gone, so is the knowledge.

If you want persistence, you need to:

    Keep the FAISS DB alive and up to date

    Track what was added and when

    Optionally, build a database abstraction layer (e.g., with SQLite metadata or manifest files)
